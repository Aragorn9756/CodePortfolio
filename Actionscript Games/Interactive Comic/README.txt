This was a group project where Me and a team of four others tried to make an mobile interactive comic using Animate, actionscript and adobe's AIR platform. I was in charge of the bus stop scene and transitions and helped with the debugging. We ended with a passable product, though we never could get it to work properly on a smartphone.

	We wanted to tell the story of a man who works in an office and lives the same life day-in, day-out. When he begins to find small objects throughout his world, he begins to find more to life than his day to day routine.
	The first thing we decided was we wanted the story to show a gradual change in the manâ€™s perception. We decided the best way to show the mans change in perception was to reflect it in his environment. There were two ways we considered doing this. The first way was for him to find a catalyst of some sort at the office and then have him go on a journey, with his environment changing to be greener/more colorful as he goes. The second option, which we ended up going with, was to have his normal environment change as he changes his perception. To show this, we decided to have a multi-day format, where the man goes through the same environments 6 days in a row. He gets out of bed, goes to the office, goes home, and visits everywhere in between each day, but something about each environment would change to mirror his changes, and to keep the player from getting bored.
	The environmental change we decided to institute was a change in color. Day one starts with every environment, each taking up a single frame, in black and white, because he internally views the world as black and white. He goes to work, comes home and repeats. Then there is an object that is not black and white, something in full color, in order to draw the eye of the player. When the player interacts with the object, the frame and all the thematically similar frames (i.e. the cubicle and all the other office frames) goes from black and white to sepia. As the player picks up more objects, the colors will continue to change, going from black and white, to sepia, to desaturated, to fully colored. This is intended to suggest to the player that these objects are adding color and variety to his life.
