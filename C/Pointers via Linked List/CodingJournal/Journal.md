## Lab Warmup
### October 24, 2020 6:32 PM MST
I completed the warmup assignment. I like how clearly everything was explained and it feels to me very intuitive how to use malloc and free. I did, however, already take a class on how this all works in c++, so I  kinda have an unfair advantage. This warmup was really just like that for me. Remembering old concepts and stretching old muscles.

This was a really fun assignment actually. It took me some mind warping, but I really enjoyed working with and manipulating linked lists. The process that gave me the most trouble was the changing around of the orders. I sat and thought about it, and for grabbing and placing the node to be moved, there are three possibilities to consider. Picking/Placing the head node, the tail node, or somewhere in the middle. That really helped me compartmentalize the problem and figure it out. Maybe in the big picture, this assignment was relatively easy, but it made me feel smart.
