## Lab Warmup

Just finished up the lab warmup. I really liked that fgets function. it worked very nicely and cleanly. I tried to use the strlen function to delimit my for loop but it gave me a warning. Apparently strlen returns an unsigned long, so I had to do a quick search to look up how to cast to an int and it worked great.

## Lab Activity

That was quite the Activity! I feel much more comfortable with arrays and character strings now! Getting rid of multiple spaces had me stumped for a second there, but I figured it out. The strcpy and strcmp functions worked wonderfully and much easier than trying to shuffle characters forward along an array.
