This was a very interesting activity. Figuring out how structs work took me a little bit and I actually had to follow along with the lectures instead of working ahead! I wonder if you every .h file has an associated .c file. Is is necessary to have a .h file, or is just the way it's done?

This activity was much more intesive than any of the previous ones, but it was also kind of enjoyable. I wanted to use strcasecmp to compare items to not be case sensitive, but I couldn't figure out how to get rid of the warnings. I still feel that the way I'm doing user valitdation is cumbersome and there has to be a better way.
