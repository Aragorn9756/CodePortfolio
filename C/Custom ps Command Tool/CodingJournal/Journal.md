This was a very interesting assignment. I think I spent as much time searching man pages and thinking through my solutions as I did coding! I'm really glad Professor Hindman kept pushing us to look at man pages throughout the semester, because knowing how to parse those really helped me figure out how to implement my code much faster than searching stack overflow ever has!
