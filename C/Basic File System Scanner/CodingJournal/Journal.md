That lab warmup took a bit of time, but I'm glad I followed the videos so closely. When I started, none of the stuff made sense, even after watching the deeper look videos, especially the getopt and function variables. Walking through the functionality, options and manual pages with Prof. Hindman though, It started to come together, and now I really do feel ready to take on the activity. I also am beginning to understand how much better it is to try and go to the man pages before stack overflow as well.
## Lab Activity

I actually really liked this lab activity. I've always struggled with using the command line, mostly because I have no real idea how it works, so everything feels so arbitrary, but now I'm starting to get a feel for why and how things work. Sorting the files in reverse gave me trouble for a minute or two. I initially tried to perform the comparison myself, but got stuck trying to double de-reference the dirents. Then I looked at the prof's hint on piazza and tried calling alphasort from within my custom function. I wasn't sure it would work, but lo and behold, it did! I feel more comfortable using command lines and looking up and understanding manPages now and I like the feeling.
