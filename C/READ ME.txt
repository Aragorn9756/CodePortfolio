The C code in this folder was written for a Systems Programming course at Boise State University. The code was written in VS Code using a custom workspace and makefile setup by my professor Luke Hindman. The lab warmups were written by me using a guided tutorial provided by Professor Hindman and the lab activities are completely my own work. Unless otherwise commented at the top of the file, all class header files and implementation files were written by me.
