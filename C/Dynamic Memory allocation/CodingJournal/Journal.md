That took quite a while to put together... I made my own tests like suggested, and it was both frustrating and helpful. It was took forever to do the tests, but it was nice to just run a quick check and know FOR SURE that a function was working the way I intended it to. And I didn't need to run through the program 50 times, manually trying all the different possibilities. It also made it much easier to track what was not working correctly. As time consuming as it was, I think It is overall worth while.
